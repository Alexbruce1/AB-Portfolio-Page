          <h1>Hello, I'm Alex Bruce</h1>
          <p>I'm a front-end software developer with a passion for problem-solving, collaboration, music, dogs, and fast cars. I've always loved solving puzzles and figuring out how things work, which has occasionally led to taking my car apart just to see what makes it tick. I've, more recently, discovered a similar love for JavaScript. I enjoy a good challenge, and live for the 'builder's high' feeling after completing something. Now, creating clean, cohesive, and powerful UIs is what occupies most of my time.</p>
